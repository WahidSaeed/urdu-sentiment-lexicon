Urdu Sentiment Lexicon
======================
The Urdu Sentiment Lexicon is a list of 2,607 positive and 4,728 negative sentiment/opinion words for Urdu. You can download the [positive](negative-words.ur.txt) and [positive](negative-words.ur.txt) lexicon from the list above. A simple javascript based application is hosted [here](http://awaisathar.github.io/urdu-sentiment-lexicon). It changes the color of the sentiment words according to their polarity and calculates the background colour of the whole text using the total polarity score of the text. Press the Sentilise button to see it in action. See [my blog post](http://chaoticity.com/urdu-sentiment-lexicon/) for more information.
